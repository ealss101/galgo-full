- Start your prompts with action words, such as *"Explain", "Summarize", "List",* or *"Compare"*.
- Be as specific as possible about what you need. For example, instead of asking *"Tell me about finance"*, ask *"Explain the basics of stock market investing"*.
- Use examples in your prompt if you need help solving a problem. For instance, *"Write a Python script to calculate loan interest"*.
- If the bot's response isnâ€™t what you expected, refine your prompt and try again.
